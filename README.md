# Path Visualizer

## Requirments
- Python version 3.8.5
- Pygame version 1.9.6

## Description
This path visualizer application utilizes five search algorithms. The algorithms are A*, BFS, DFS, Dijkstra and an 
implementation of the BFS biderectional algorithm. Read the usage below for more info on how to use the application.

## Usage 
- After you place the obstacles(walls) and select a cell as the starting node and a cell as the destination node, pick an algorithm and double click the "Visualize" button.
- After the visualize button is pressed all other operations are restricted except the "Try again" and "Quit" operations.
- Press the "Generate Random Maze" button before any other operation.
- This project was made with the 3.8.5 version of python and the 1.9.6 version of pygame.
